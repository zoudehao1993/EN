That's the total number of different styles, in all the different sizes.
And that's reduced batch sizes,
long runs on an item are a thing of the past.
At least half the styles used to be carried through from one year to the next,
but now only a quarter are,
so as you can see,it's had quite an impact on the rate of change.
What's the effect on the machinists?
That policy was part of a raft of changes,
one of which is that the machinists are now paid on a piecework basis,
rather than at an hourly rate.
They're furious about that, though to be fair,
the rate that's paid for learning to use a new machine has been calculated so as to make sure that no one loses out in the short term.
And they're also aggrieved because so much is new,
and far more batches of work fail quality inspections and have to be redone.
Now tell me something about training...
